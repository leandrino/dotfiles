" BASIC SETUP
" enter the current millenium
set nocompatible

" enable syntax and plugx (for netew)
syntax enable
filetype plugin on

" FINDING FILES

" Search down into subfolders
" Provides tab-completion for all file-lated tasks
set path+=**

" Display all matchin files when we tab complete
set wildmenu

" TAG JUMPING

" Create the `tags` file (may need to install ctags first)
command! MakeTags !ctags -R .

" Now we can:
" - Use ^] to jump to tag under cursor
" - Use g^] for ambiguous tags
" - Use ^t to jump back up the tag stack


" AUTOCOMPLETE

" The good stuff is documented in |ins-completion|

" Highlights:
" - ^x^n for JUST this file
" - ^x^f for filenames (works with our path trick!)
" - ^x^] for tags only
" - ^n for anything specified by the 'complete' option

" Now we can:
" - Use ^n and ^p to go back and forth in the suggestion list

" FILE BROWSING

" Tweaks for browsing
let g:netrw_banner=0	      " disable annoying banner
let g:netrw_browse_split=4    " open in prior window
let g:netrw_altv=1            " open splits to the right
let g:netrw_liststyle=3       " tree view
let g:netrw_list_hide=netrw_gitignore#Hide()
let g:netrw_list_hide.=',\<^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+'

" How we can:
" - :edit a folder to open a file browser
" - <CR>/v/t to open in an h-split/v-split/tab
" - check |netrw-browse-maps| for mor mapping
